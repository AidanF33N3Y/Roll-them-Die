# Roll-them-Die
This is a classic dice game with a twist. The person who wins is the person who has the least amount of moves.
Input the Winning score, the amount of players and then just roll them die!

This is the first project that I made almost completely from scratch. Any ideas, implementations or critiques would gladly be appreciated.
